	<h2>Projects</h2>
	
	<h3>This Website</h3>
	This is my online portfolio, which started as an assignment in ENG 100. Throughout this project I learned basic web development by coding in HTML/CSS, utilized source control for the project with Github, and managed my website hosting through FTP. I also implemented my own novel feature to the website by adding &lt;write about it here>.
	
	<h3>Creating Mike from Monsters Inc. in MAYA</h3>
	I randomly took up a course in MAYA during the summer break and spent a month creating a 3D model of Mike and then animating him.
	
	<h3>Programming Tic-Tac-Toe</h3>
	My high school programming project was on Tic-Tac-Toe which I achieved through functions, graphics, matrices etc. It was a success.
