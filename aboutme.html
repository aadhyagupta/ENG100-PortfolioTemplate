	<h2>About Me</h2>
	
	<img id="profile-picture" src="assets/img/FirstnameLastname.jpg" width="200" height="300" class="floatright" />
	<p>Hiya, my name is Aadhya Gupta and I am currently a Computer Science major at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and am an Indian who has lived her whole life in Dubai.
	In high school, I was part of the annua dance, was part of a computer programming club, and often volunteered in clean up drives. 
	My hobbies include playing the piano and working on my 3D animation projects. Fun fact: No one in the university has pronounced my name properly yet.</p>
	
	<p>While at UIUC, I am interested in joining ACM and the WCS (Women in Computer Science. I look forward to making new friends from all over the world! </p>
	
	<p>	Take a second to look at my <a href="assets/Resume-FirstnameLastname.pdf">r�sum�</a>!</p>
